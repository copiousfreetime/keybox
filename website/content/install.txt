h1. Requirements

Keybox uses the SHA256 digest algorithm in its work and this was not
available in OpenSSL until version 0.9.8.  As a result, the ruby
installation that runs keybox must be compiled against an OpenSSL
library of 0.9.8 or greater.

h1. Quick Installation

There are no prerequisites other than a basic ruby install that
includes the OpenSSL libraries as part of the standard lib.

The simplest install for keybox is via rubygems:

<pre>
<code>
    gem install keybox
</code>
</pre>

h1. Installing without gems

Keybox does not require any gems to operate from an end-user perspective
so you can just "download the .tgz or .zip file from
Rubyforge":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=2584 and
extract it into a directory.  

<pre>
<code>
    % tar zvf keybox-1.0.0.tgz
    % cd keybox-1.0.0
    % ./bin/keybox --help
</code>
</pre>

Then to utilize it with non-standard locations for the *config.yaml* and
*database.yaml* you would just use the command line options.  So for
instance, given the following:

* ruby installed on the host machine
* USB Drive mounted on */Volumes/MyData/*
* keybox on that drive under *MyData/keybox-1.0.0*

I could execute keybox against my portable setup with:

<pre>
<code>
% cd /Volumes/MyData/keybox-1.0.0
% ./bin/keybox --config=./data/config.yaml --database=./data/database.yml
</code>
</pre>
