h1. Keybox Project

*Keybox* is a set of command line applications and
ruby libraries for secure password storage and password generation.

Using only the core ruby and the ruby standard library, Keybox provides
a portable secure mechanism for password management.

Keybox provides 2 command line applications, *keybox* and *kpg*

* *keybox* %- a pure ruby command line password storage application that uses the OpenSSL libraries included with ruby for the encryption.%
* *kpg* %- a pure ruby implementation of the Automated Password Generator (apg) program. It attempts to implemented all the functionality of 'apg', but it is not completely compatible.%
