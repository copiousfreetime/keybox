== DESCRIPTION:

Keybox is a set of command line applications and ruby libraries for
secure password storage and password generation.  

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

Provides the following command line applications

* keybox - a pure ruby command line password storage application using
           the embedded OpenSSL included with ruby for encryption.

* kpg - a pure ruby implementation of the Automated Password Generator
        (apg) program. It attempts to implemented all the functionality
        of 'apg', but it is not completely compatible.  

The full functionality of the command line applications is also
available via included ruby libraries and could be embedded in other
applications.
