h1. Quick Installation

There are no prerequisites other than a basic ruby install that
includes the OpenSSL libraries as part of the standard lib.

The simplest install for keybox is via rubygems:

<pre>
<code>
    gem install keybox
</code>
</pre>

h1. Installing without gems.

Keybox does not require any gems to operate from an end-user perspective
so you can just download the .tgz or .zip file from Rubyforge and
extract it into a directory.  

<pre>
<code>
    % tar zvf keybox-1.0.0.tgz
    % cd keybox-1.0.0
    % ./bin/keybox --help
</code>
</pre>

Then to utilize it with non-standard locations for the *config.yaml* and
*database.yaml* you would just use the command line options.  So for
instance I had a usb drive that had keybox locally on it and I had a
directory in it =<drive-root>/keybox/my-data=

<pre>
<code
