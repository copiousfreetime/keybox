load_plugin 'webgen/plugins/filehandlers/filehandler'

module MiscPlugins

    # This plugin registers as a listener for message :after_node_written 
    # with the 'Core/FileHandler' plugin.
    # 
    # When its callback is invoked, if the node in question is a file or
    # directory it records the nodes fully expanded path in @files
    #
    # The list of files currently rendered can then be retrieved by
    # getting a handle on this plugin and calling +files+.
    #
    #   Example:
    #
    #       @plugin_manager['Misc/RenderedFiles'].files
    #
    class RenderedFilesPlugin < Webgen::Plugin
